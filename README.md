# molecular_descriptor_analysis
molecular descriptor analysis of natural compounds
Compounds were obtained from the supernatural database
Feature reduction technique (PCA) was used 
Unsupervised learning algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clusterings enabled the selection of the right compounds.
This repository contains several codes for molecular descriptor calculation using the rdkit library
dimensionality reduction using PCA
K-means and hierarchical clusterings with performance evaluations
